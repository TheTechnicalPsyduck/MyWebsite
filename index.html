        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello everyone, I am currently making this website to advance my IT Career and show my learning progress with anyone that would like to follow. As you can see this website is super basic and not cool looking at all but I plan on changing that as I Progress through an HTML course.
            <br><br>
            You also will see that my Grammar and Spelling will suck balls but that is okay we will also work on that as well as we build the website. 
        </p>
        <h2>What I am working on</h2>

        <p>I am currently working on learning HTML (as you can see from the looks of the current website) as well as studying to get my CompTIA A+ certification. After I achieve this goal I will set a different goal for the future.</p>

        <h2>Current Career and Education</h2>

        <p>I work as a Senior IT Support Specialist at a school district. I also worked in healthcare as a helpdesk specialist and was promoted to application support specialist. I Have a bachelor's degree in Business Administration with a focus on management and marketing and a minor in information technology. I also worked part-time as a student tech at the college I attended.</p>
